# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This personal project is part of my portfolio and aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data by exploring a rich dataset. I wrote a series of SQL commands to understand the progression of the virus in terms of infections and deaths, as well as testing and vaccination rates to study their effects on various demographics, and identify potential correlations and trends.
